This is just a cloud storage account I use to keep my code and sometimes share it with github (this means that the shared code is worthwhile)
This account is often inactive so I don't think I'll reach you unless you contact me somewhere else.

(Currently making a 2d game engine (in python because why not) and trying to figure out what LWJGL is)

In the meantime, have this cool pastebin link: https://pastebin.com/jABwwnu6
